The basic objective of this project is that given a known arm configuration and goal position, the arm should successfully reach that position.
To go about for the objective we will be using genetic algorithm approach. The basic objectives of the project are -
1. Split module design separating the higher level intelligence from dynamixel driver.
2. 6DOF basic arm manipulation.
3. Simple yet accurate specification of the motor configuration for the dynamixel drivers.
4. Use gazebo for simulation.
5. Parallelization of GA code.
6. Eliminate Singularity.
7. Obstacle avoidance.
